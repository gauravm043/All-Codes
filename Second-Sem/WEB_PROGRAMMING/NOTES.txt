we have a thing requires(=IS_EMAIL().....) and required(True) 

in a col name can do Field('resume','upload')             ///  type is defined as upload
and also date



NOTE THAT nmap 127.0.0.1    OR NMAPPING THE IFCONFIG  SHOWS ACTIVE SERVERS ON UR MACHINES


we have an MVC structure 
NEED - there is an independence among them we can redefine the views but the models will remain the same


automatically web2py appends an id col for every table u hv created

see some things on welcome---->default.py enter_student

IF A FIELD IS REQ. TO CONTAIN A VALUE DO notnull=True



============>>>>>>   A VERY IMP POINT IS TO CREATE A FORM 

form=SQLFORM(db.student)
return dict(form=form)

unique=True
label=enter....


2==>>

REFER TO GENERAL FORMAT FOR QUERING DATABASES IN SIRS NOTES


REQUIRED=TRUE IS NOT DEFINED FOR A DATABASE BUT WE WANT IT FOR A FORM OF A TABLE   


notnull=True does the validation at the DB level                                              ## KEY POINT
and required=True  works for forms
