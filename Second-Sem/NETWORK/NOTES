on doing ifconfig we get 
-> subnet mask - 255.255.255.0
hwaddr-> it is the mac address
inet-> ip of subnet
network address = mask.IP

in a subnet we have layer 2 of communication ie we can use only MAC(64-BIT) addr for commu.


TTL is time to live 

we have a 7 layer OSI model
the big boxes in lab are  switches
any 2 comp. in machines can commu. through certain protocol eg- ETHERNET

-->> NOW HERE WHEN WE TRY TO COMMUNICATE VIA PING THE ARP TECH IS USED AND FROM IP WE CAN GET MAC ADDRESS



1-Physical
2-Data Link
3-Network
4-Transport
5-Application


When multi commu. takes place -->> collission to avoid it we use a switch.
switch will forward the packet after using MAC address to find the correct port
therefore a switch facilitates multiple talking

SWITCH IS L2 DEVICE

Now when we want to communicate to comp. of other subnets we  cant do it in L2 we need to get to L3 where we use gateways
When we want to send a packet to other subnet our pc will and mask with ip of receiver eg- 10.3.5.1 send to 10.4.4.2
here the network mask is same(since same network) but there subnetaddresses are different and ==>> they are on diff subnets
A gateway has multiple interfaces which keep record of ip addrs or diff subnets



NOW OUR COMP. WILL SEND PACKET TO A GATEWAY IFF THE SUBNET ADDRESS IS NOT ITS OWN ELSE IT WILL SEND PACKET TO A SWITCH
TO SEE THE GATEWAY(Router)--->>>>>



route -n


for 0.0.0.0(not known any one) gateway is defined

Now to avoid looping back to same machine we define a ttl assigned ( in L3 device) and every time it is passing by a L3 device like gateway ttl is decreased by 1 and if a looping back condi is there ttl=0 and the packet is dropped and a ttl is assigned o a packet by our own machine eg-

ping proxy ttl---->>> 63 
ping subnet ttl--->>>64
